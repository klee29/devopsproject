Title: First step of DevOps Engineering

Goal: Understanding DevOps engineering with popular tools such as docker, kubernete, jenkins, ansible, and so on.

Purpose: I try to look up and combine DevOps engineering feature what I learned until now. With this project, I'm going to make two or three tier web appliication system and then check my strong and weak point about this technologies and then improve this later on. 

This is 'DevOps Engineering' project with several technical features below:
- Container - Docker
- Orchestrating Contatiner - Kubernetes, EKS or ECS
- CI/CD - Jenkins
- Source Control - Github
- Automation - Ansible
 (Additional tool can be added if it needed)

First step: Set up environment 
What should I think about this? 
- What kind of element we need to think? Server: AWS, Service: Apache Tomcat, MySQL, Jenkins, Github
- What else? All service runs on docker
- What is unfamiliar concept on me? Configuration (Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, Github, and etc)
